# Maniac Mansion Mania Episode 40: Trapped in the Cellar

This is my very first self-developed point-and-click adventure game from 2006, which I developed with AGS 2.62 by Chris Jones. Although I knew very little about game development at the age of 15, I was able to make my first steps with AGS with the help of the Adventure Meeting Forum and the Maniac Mansion Mania Community. 
Because of the mediocre ratings and the bad puzzle design I have an improved version with better puzzle design and a lot of humor in December 2006. My game is not only the first episode of the Maniac Mansion Mania series with Razor as playable character, 
but also the first MMM episode available in six languages: English, French, German, Spanish, Portuguese and Italian. 
You can download the compiled and playable version here: https://maniac-mansion-mania.com/index.php/en/spiele/episoden/staffel-4/58-episode-40-verflixte-t.html Now you are free to look into the source code. 
Keep in mind I was about 16 when I last modified the programming code. Today I have improved my programming skills. 
Important: On today's operating systems, especially Windows 10, you will probably have difficulties getting the game to run. 
I recommend you to ask questions to the German Maniac Mansion Mania Forum here: https://www.maniac-mansion-mania.de/forum/index.php Don't worry, you have the possibility to write in English. Our community have even fans outside of Germany, like in Italy. 

Thanks for Ron Gilbert and Gary Winnick for creating Maniac Mansion and thanks to LucasFan for creating the fan adventure based Maniac Mansion Mania series. 
I would like to thank the Maniac Mansion Mania Community for allowing me to fulfill my childhood dream of creating my very first adventure game and Chris Jones for Adventure Game Studio.

Have fun!
